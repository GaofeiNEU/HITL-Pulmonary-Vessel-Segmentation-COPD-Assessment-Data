# HITL-Pulmonary-Vessel-Segmentation-COPD-Assessment-Data
This repository provides the annotated datasets and related resources used in the study:

**“Accurate Segmentation of Pulmonary Arteries and Veins via a Human-in-the-Loop Framework with Application in COPD.”**

The released datasets support reproducibility, benchmarking, and future research on pulmonary vascular analysis, small-vessel segmentation, and COPD-associated vascular remodeling.

**Available Datasets**

**1. Refined HiPaS/ParSe 2022 Pulmonary Artery–Vein Annotations (30 cases)**

These are high-quality annotations generated using our Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) refinement process, extending the original ParSe 2022 labels with improved continuity and enhanced small-vessel delineation.

**2. COPD-Related Pulmonary Vascular Assessment Dataset (125 cases)**

This dataset contains 125 non-enhanced CT scans used to analyze pulmonary arterial and venous trees indices. It includes 34 GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) 1, 35 GOLD 2, 35 GOLD 3, and 21 GOLD 4 cases.
